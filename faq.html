	<h2>Questions</h2>

	<h3>Why a python coding contest?</h3>
	<p>
		Coding contests are a lot of fun and programming in python is even
		more fun. This is why we feel an urge to combine those two things.
	</p>

	<h3>How do you determine the shortest program?</h3>
	<p>
		The shortest program is the one that uses the fewest characters to
		solve the problem, and yes whitespaces do count.
	</p>
	<h3>Which python version do you use?</h3>
	<p>
		Python 2.4 on linux.
	</p>

	<h3>Am I allowed to...?</h3>
	<p>
		If your solution passes the  
		<a href="http://www.pycontest.net/htdocs/pycontest_01.tar.gz">test case</a>
		it has a good chance to be accepted.
	</p>
	<h3>May I circumvent the test suite?</h3>
	<p>
		Be aware that we use a different test suite to either
		accept or reject pendig submissions. We believe that this prevents
		circumvention.
	</p>
	<p>
		In addition, submissions are checked for malicious code by plain old
		humans.
	</p>

	<h3>Is the use of webservices allowed?</h3>
	<p>
		No.
	</p>

	<h3>Is there any relation between the 22c3 and pycontest.net?</h3>
	<p>
		The coding contest is coincidentally held during the 
		<a href="http://events.ccc.de/congress/2005/" title="the 22nd Chaos Communication Congress">22c3</a>
		and 
		it is open to everybody.
		
	</p>

	<h3>Who covers the shipping costs for my price?</h3>
	<p>
		Our sponsor covers shipping costs up to 30 bugs.
		This should be sufficient for most of the globe. If the winner lives in
		some exotic region we have to work out a solution.
	</p>
	<h3>I didn't win, may i sue you?</h3>
	<p>
		Our mission is to run pycontest.net in a sound manner. Special care
		is taken to be fair, provide the winner with a price and all others
		with lots of fun. However we take no legal liability to be successful
		with our mission. 
	</p>
